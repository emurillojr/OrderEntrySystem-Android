Order Entry System In Android <br>
Create a candy order taking system in Android. <br>
Create an order class that will have the following properties: <br>
•	The first name of the buyer <br>
•	The last name of the buyer <br>
•	A string representing the type of chocolate <br>
•	A number representing the number of bars bought in an order <br>
•	A Boolean value representing the type of shipping (normal or expedited). <br>
For simplicity sake, each order has the following characteristics: <br>
•	Each order will be for only one kind of candy bar <br>
•	If a person wants to order several candy bars, they will need to enter a second complete order for the second candy bar <br>
Your android program will have the following features: <br>
•	A way for the user to enter a first name <br>
•	A way for the user to enter a last name <br>
•	A way for the user to enter the number of chocolate bars (note, the program will only accept a number) <br>
•	A list of chocolate bars that the user can pick (not typed in by the user). <br>
•	Radio buttons to signify the two kinds of shipping <br>
•	A button for the user to place the order <br>
•	When the order is placed, an acknowledgement message will be shown that also shows how many chocolate bar orders have been ordered. <br>
•	The program will implement an arraylist of the order class to implement the orders. <br>
